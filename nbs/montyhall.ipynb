    "[The Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a famous brain teaser, which often is confusing. The problem statement is;  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\t\n",
    "\n",
    "At first it seems like since there are only two doors left, it would not matter to switch your pick or not. However, careful reasoning using probability implies it is better to switch your decision at that point.  \n",
